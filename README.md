#Internship-Assignment
~ Repository containing my solutions to the internship assignment given

###Question 1: Data analysis using Pandas
This has been answered in the Earth_AI python document in the Earth AI folder. Kindly refer to the solution there.

###Question 2: Optimization Techniques
A binary classifier that will be used by the police to predict from the face of a passenger in the airport whether he or she is a terrorist.
- **Answer:** For this case, since our model can be categorised into two distinct categories i.e terrorist/non-terrorist using sentiment analysis, we can use a vector machine in plotting our points and optimise our hyper-parameters using a Bayesian optimisation formula which picks a prior belief and then searches the parameter space by enforcing and updating that prior belief during training. This is a fast and more efficient approach to adjusting our hyper-parameters such as the learning rate, weights and bias values of our algorithm.

A binary classifier that will be used by a mineral exploration company to predict from the satellite images whether a remote location in outback Australia contains a valuable core body.
- **Answer:** Considering the nature of this problem, it is safe to assume that there would be a lot of irregularities in such spatial analysis and based on this, I have researched on optimization algorithms that work well with such datasets and avoid local minima traps. The best option I came across was the Adam(Adaptive learning rate methodology approach). Based on research, it helps with quicker convergence and proper learning.

###Notes
For question two, I have not included any formula's for my suggested optimization techniques as I do not fully understand them yet however with little practice, I am sure I would come around to understand them as I understand the overall objective of an optimization algorithm for machine learning.
